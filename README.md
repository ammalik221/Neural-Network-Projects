# Neural Network based Projects

This repository contains Deep Learning projects as well some jupyter notebooks containing DL and ML techniques for future reference.

## CS-231n (To-Do)
Completed Assignment solutions for CS231n: [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html), provided by Stanford.

## Image Style Transfer
Compose one image in the style of another image. This is an optimization technique which uses two images and blends them together, so that output image looks like one image in the style of the other image.
