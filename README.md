# Neural Network based Projects

This repository contains Deep Learning projects as well some jupyter notebooks containing DL and ML techniques for future reference.

## CS-231n
Completed Assignment solutions for CS231n: [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html), provided by Stanford.

## Image Style Transfer
Compose one image in the style of another image. This is an optimization technique which uses two images and blends them together, so that output image looks like one image in the style of the other image.

## EDA on data provided on kaggle
Dataset contains all posts tagged AI, Machine Learning, Data Science or Aritificial Intelligence on Medium. Purpose was to identify relations between variou features and the number of claps recieved on posts.

<!--## Deep photo Style Transfer
Deep-learning approach to photographic style transfer that handles a large variety of image content while faithfully transferring the reference style.-->
